# Bio
I am Amit Rai, a 3rd year Computer Science undergraduate student at Netaji Subhash Engineering College. I joined the DSC NSEC Core Team in February 2019. 
I started of mainly with helping at event management and by the end of the year ended up being one of the facilitators of GCP Crash Course program held in October 2019. 
DSC has taught me a lot about team work and given me the opportunity to work with some really talented people. The most important lesson I learnt is how we learn better by helping others.
