# Bio
I am Shashwat Sinha, currently in 3rd year pursuing my Btech in IT from Netaji Subhash Engineering College. I facilitated the ExploreML program on my campus. 
I started off with web development in the 2nd sem of my college and by working on several projects, I came across some really enthusiastic people around me.
As a core member of DSC NSEC, I got many opportunities to work on projects related to web and ML which enhanced my skills on those subjects. 
I got a chance to take sessions and speak in public which was really a nightmare for me. Currently, I am working on Security of Cloud using Machine Learning.
