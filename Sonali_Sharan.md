# Bio
Hey there! I am Sonali Sharan. I am currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in Information technology from Netaji Subhash Engineering College, Kolkata. My journey with DSC NSEC began when our lead said me that coding is not everything you need.
I have soft skills which made me stand out from the crowd. DSC is a learning and exploring path for me. I am interested in SEO and have done courses from google and still learning from Moz academy. Choosing SEO was not a tough job under our lead guidance.
DSC is a platform that many dreams of, I feel lucky to be part of DSC NSEC.
