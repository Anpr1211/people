## Bio

My name is Faiz Alam and Iâ€™m a 3rd year IT student. My journey with DSC NSEC began when our lead asked me to join his core team. I am also one of the lead Graphics Designer at DSC. By being in the core team I learnt a lot in the field of designing as the requirements for each event are different and we had to come up with something innovative for each of the events. I am also a machine learning and android enthusiast.
