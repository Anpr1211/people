Bio

Hello, I am Anuska Sinha, a 2nd Year undergraduate from the IT Department. I have been a part of DSC NSEC from my very first days of college in my 1st year. Since then it has been a great journey of learning and gaining knowledge from incredible people. I am a part of the designing team and I was the facilitator of the Data Science track in the GCP Crash Course. I am very enthusiastic about ML, AI and Web Development. My special interest lies in Ethical Hacking. It has always been a great thing to be a part of the DSC NSEC Community as it helps you grow together and meet with amazing colleagues and seniors who are ready to help you at every step in your way to success and growth in life.
