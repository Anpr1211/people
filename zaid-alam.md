## Bio

My name is Zaid Alam and I’m a 3rd year IT student. My journey with DSC began when I attended the first MLCC event organised by Anubhav Singh in mid 2018 under the Department of Information Technology. Although DSC wasn’t a club in our college back then but still a continuous and never ending knowledge sharing relationship had been built. In the coming month DSC was an official club of our college and I couldn’t be happier. DSC has given me a lot on a personal level. I’m now working on Network Security in Cloud Environment, and working my way through what ML and AI has to offer. Besides this I’m also an App developer trying on different frameworks like Native and Flutter. I probably would have been working on everything that I am working on now but again, if it weren’t for the beautiful community we have built, I’d be miles behind and much slower.
