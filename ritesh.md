Bio
Hey there, I am Ritesh Prasad Singh from the Department of Information Technology currently in my 2nd year of this course. I joined DSC when I was in my 1st year. I am a UI/UX Designer and a Front-end Web Developer. Other than these I am passionate in the areas of Data Science and Machine Learning. I am currently working on searching algorithms and data visualization. Being one of the DSC NSEC members I could both contribute and learn at the same time.
