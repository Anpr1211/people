## Bio
I am Varun Vishal. I am a 2nd Year IT student. I joined DSC NSEC as a graphic designer when I had the chance to work with them for an event of Cloud Study Jams. Since then I have been provided multiple opportunities to learn and improve my skills under this club. I have also designed several websites for the club and made several designs for the same.
