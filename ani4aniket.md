## Bio

I am a full stack developer, freelancer and leading the web-team at DSC-NSEC (2019-20). I first got familiar with computers and aspects of software development in high school, seeing the great and ever-increasing utility of the same continued to fuel my desire to learn more. In pursuit of exploring different fields of computer science, I began learning web development in my freshman year and worked on projects, which proved to be immensely enlightening. 
I mainly work on JavaScript frameworks and published a lot of mobiles apps and website in the industry. DSC-NSEC was a great and unforgettable journey in my college days, we are a bunch of passionate development and design enthusiasts trying to foster software development culture on the campus.
