## Bio
I am Aritr Roy Gosthipaty, currently pursuing my undergraduation in the field of Electronics and Communication from Netaji Subhash Engineering College.
 My story begins from being trusted at with technology. The lead of DSC NSEC (Anubhav Singh) trusted a guy and gave him the opportunities to pursue his curiosity in software development.
 I was fortunate enough to speak at various events through this community.
 I am an avid android developer who is also trying to apply `model.fit` to different datasets. You can find me [here](https://arig23498.github.io/).
