## Bio
I am Ayush Thakur, currently in the final year of my undergraduation in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Netaji Subhash Engineering College.
I am also an ex-Chair of IEEE Electron Device Society, NSEC. My friendship and collaborations with Anubhav Singh(ex DSC Lead) started approximately a year before the establishment of DSC NSEC and him being the DSC Lead. I know him for his ability to turn dreams into reality through his determination and an ability to trust others around him. Under his leadership, DSC hosted many events and I was trusted with multiple opportunities of being a speaker to share my knowledge. He knew about my areas of interest which are in Deep Learning and Computer Vision and allowed me to share my interest with others. They were all awesome experiences and I feel fortunate to know him in person.
