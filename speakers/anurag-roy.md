## Bio

I am Anurag Roy, currently a final year undergrad in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Netaji Subhash Engineering College. I am mainly a Flutter developer, but also have programming experience in various languages and have a keen interest in UI/UX design, AI, front end web and native Android development.

My passion for writing code began since I wrote (and was fascinated by) my first C program to add two numbers. DSCNSEC provided a platform by which I could use this passion for contribution. I had been a regular attendee and a participant in various workshops and contests organized by the club.

Thus it came as a surprise to me when I was given an opportunity by the club lead _Anubhav Singh_ to conduct a workshop on `Flutter` to share my knowledge, and for that, I am grateful.
